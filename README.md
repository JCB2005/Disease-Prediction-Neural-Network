# Disease-Prediction-Neural-Network

This is a small project I'm doing for fun that uses a combination of a feed forward neural network and natural selection to predict diseases from their symptoms.

The program tries to use neural networks and natural selection to simulate the evolution of a simple brain and it's ability to perform a task.
